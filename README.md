The background use visualitation is report final project bachelor degree Telecommunication Engineer.

The basic principles of blockchain, including decentralization, transparency, and immutability, provide a solid foundation for addressing the challenges of security, privacy, and ownership of identity data. Satellite communication technology plays an important role in sectors such as telecommunications, defense, navigation, and research. Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) has three main components: modem, Block up Converter (BuC), satellite dish, and router. By relying on the unique id in the satellite modem, the integration of blockchain network and satellite communication network can be implemented. 
Identity Management (IdM) offers three main solutions namely ShoCard, Uport, and Sovrin. Cryptographic technologies in blockchain and identity management such as hash function and Elliptical Curve Digital Signature (ECDSA) have a very important influence on the blockchain network. Unique ideas in satellite modems are key devices in managing and integrating communications to control centers that can be integrated through blockchain networks. When simulating a blockchain network that has been integrated with a unique id on a satellite modem. Testing the computation time of blocks and nodes in the identity management (IdM) blockchain system, the average computation time of blocks is 0.207719 seconds and nodes is 0.266318325 seconds. Other variables can affect the computation time of blocks and nodes, on nodes, nonce (difficulty level) reaches relatively high due to the complexity of programming complexity regarding this node can reach the highest computation time point of 1.199 seconds with nonce 350795. Blocks only use a programming level based on PoW consensus and use hash security techniques, the highest computation time is only at 0.7692 seconds with a nonce of 212556.
